# cnnGRUvhdl

## Project

Custom IP component for the acceleration of a low-precision CNN-GRU neural network architecture in inference mode. The component is integrated in both DE10-Standard and DE10-Nano boards by Terasic, including IntelFPGA's CycloneV SoC.
The accelerator was designed for real-time scalp EEG epileptic seizure prediction. Potential applications include closed-loop neuro-stimulation for the prevention of onsets in cases patients are unresponsive to medication (about 30%), and acceleration of automatized seizure prediction/detection for assistance in medical environment.
